# neural_net
WORK IN PROGRESS: Do not use. 

This is my first attempt at a neural net, from scratch, no imports. I have yet to come up with a use case for it: I can't decide on physics (solutions to molecular dynamics problems or schrodinger equations) or a bitcoin price predictor. 

I'll likely use C sharp for this as Python would be cheating and C# is faster.
