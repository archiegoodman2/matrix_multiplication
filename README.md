WORK IN PROGRESS

Full stack translation app. Takes images of handwritten words and translates them to a foreign language using LibreTranslate API.

Stack: MERN

Mongo DB (translation history)
Express.js for any APIs to retrieve/post translation history
React front end - frontend to include picture upload page, page to view current translations and prior ones
Node - running on Node runtime - may potentially upgrade to bun if I purchase a mac/download linux 

Will potentially pivot to React Native and transition to a mobile app
